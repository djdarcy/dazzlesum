## [1.3.5] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Branch-aware git hook validation with strict mode for main branch
- Better development workflow with tiered quality gates
- Test suite validation (all 77 unit tests now passing)

### Changed
- Exit code logic now uses aggregate results for recursive operations instead of individual directory codes
- Enhanced CI/CD alignment between local pre-push hooks and GitHub Actions
- Improved test infrastructure reliability and error reporting

### Fixed
- Fixed exit code calculation bug where individual directory codes overrode aggregate results

- Fixed CI/CD alignment issues between local lint checks and GitHub Actions (added --count flag)
- Corrected test assertions for aggregate-based exit code behavior in test_squelch_and_grand_totals.py
- Fixed pre-push hook to use same test runner as CI/CD pipeline

### Technical
- Exit code determination now based on aggregate verification results across all directories
- Pre-push hooks with tiered validation: strict mode for main branch, standard for others
- Local lint checks now match CI behavior with --count flag for consistent error reporting
- All unit tests pass in both local and CI environments with proper aggregate exit code logic

## [1.3.4] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Interactive monolithic file overwrite handling with detailed file information display
- Helpful user guidance for monolithic mode operations
- Auto-overwrite support with --yes flag for automation and scripting
- Cross-platform atomic file replacement (Windows vs Unix compatibility)

### Changed
- Enhanced monolithic mode user experience with interactive guidance prompts
- Improved error messages and user guidance for common scenarios
- Fixed auto-detected verify mode to show SUCCESS summaries appropriately

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows-specific [WinError 183] file overwrite errors with atomic replacement
- Resolved missing yes_to_all parameter in execute_create_action()
- Corrected monolithic temp file inclusion in checksum generation
- Fixed argument filtering issues in interactive prompts
- Updated CLI tests to reflect new interactive prompt behavior

### Technical
- Removed 187 lines of dead code including duplicate command handlers
- Eliminated orphaned dispatch_command() and handle_*_command() functions
- Simplified execution flow: main() → execute_main_action() → execute_*_action()
- Reduced codebase by ~4% with no functionality loss
- All tests pass with improved coverage

## [1.3.3] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Smart static versioning system with git hook automation (format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH_BuildNumber-YYYYMMDD-CommitHash)
- Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml for PEP 517/518 compliance
- 11-level verbosity system (-6 to +4) replacing binary quiet/verbose flags
- Intelligent squelch system with configurable output categories (SUCCESS, NO_SHASUM, etc.)
- Context-aware CLI with pure subparser architecture (create, verify, update, manage commands)
- Complete shadow directory support (Phase 1+2) for keeping source directories clean
- Enhanced verification with percentage-based status system (e.g., "99%/1% ALMOST PERFECT")
- Grand totals system with cross-directory statistics aggregation for recursive operations
- Auto-detection for monolithic checksum files with smart behavior selection
- Resume functionality for interrupted operations

### Changed
- Replaced binary --quiet/--verbose with 11-level spectrum system with arithmetic calculation
- Progressive information disclosure design with smart defaults to reduce noise
- Enhanced help system with better topic coverage and dedicated help commands
- Improved output formatting with compact mode for large datasets
- Semantic clarity improvements: --output renamed to --checksum-file in verify command
- Clean output mode with optional log type prefixes
- Prettified color system with cross-platform ANSI support

### Fixed
- Fixed progress bar scrolling and accurate counting issues
- Resolved Python 3.7 compatibility by removing walrus operator usage
- Corrected verification workflow for clone scenarios
- Enhanced error handling and graceful degradation
- Fixed CI/CD integration with automatic version injection

### Technical
- Modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- VerbosityConfig class for centralized verbosity management
- GrandTotals class for cross-directory statistics tracking
- ColorFormatter with cross-platform support
- Test suite with 45+ tests and full CI/CD integration
- Documentation overhaul with 400+ lines of new shadow directory guide
- Eliminates pip install deprecation warnings with future-proof packaging
- Standalone files maintain complete version information without git dependencies

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-27

### Added

- .shasum management operations (backup/remove/restore/list)
- Dual-mode generation (individual/monolithic/both)

- DOS compatibility improvements
- Problems-only verification output (shows only failed, missing, or extra files by default)
- Visual directory separation in output
- Progress tracking for large operations
- Comprehensive statistics for verification operations

### Changed
- Verification now shows only problems by default (use `--show-all-verifications` for full output)
- Improved cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Better integration with native system tools (certutil, shasum, fsum)

### Fixed
- Line ending normalization for consistent checksums across platforms
- Symlink/junction loop detection
- Memory efficiency improvements for large directory trees

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

- Recursive directory processing
- Checksum verification functionality
- Incremental update capability
- File filtering with include/exclude patterns

## Future Planned Features

### Shadow Directory Support
Parallel verification directories for clean source verification without "dirtying" source directories with `.shasum` files.

### Incremental Updates
Smart update detection that only processes changed files while maintaining consistency.

### Compression Support
Archive support for checksum collections to reduce storage overhead.

### Remote Storage Integration
Potential cloud backup integration for checksum files (under consideration).
